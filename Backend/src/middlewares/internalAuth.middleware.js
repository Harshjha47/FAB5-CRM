/**
 * Guards internal service-to-service routes (e.g. the BI Server pulling
 * the nightly CRM snapshot). Not for browser/user-facing auth — this is
 * a shared-secret check between trusted backend services.
 *
 * Set INTERNAL_API_KEY in the CRM app's environment, and configure the
 * BI Server's cron job to send the same value in the x-internal-api-key
 * header on its GET request.
 *
 * Swap-out note: if you move to mTLS or an IP allowlist later, this
 * middleware is the only file that needs to change — the route/
 * controller below don't need to know how auth is implemented.
